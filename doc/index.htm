    <h1>The Acoustics Toolbox<br>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
      The Acoustics Toolbox is a collection of acoustic models and
      related software for studying sound propagation in an ocean
      waveguide. Actually, the models have been structured to be
      suitable for general wave propagation problems; however, the ocean
      application is our main focus.</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">The acoustic models in the
      package are:</p>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li><o:p><o:p><a href="kraken.htm">KRAKEN</a> normal mode approach
            <o:p> </o:p></o:p></o:p></li>
      <li><a href="scooter.htm">SCOOTER</a> spectral integral (also know
        as wavenumber integration or the reflectivity method </li>
      <li><o:p><o:p><a href="bounce.htm">BOUNCE</a> calculation of a
            reflection coefficient for a stack of layers <o:p> </o:p></o:p></o:p></li>
      <li><a href="bellhop.htm">BELLHOP</a> Gaussian beam tracing and
        ray tracing code </li>
      <li><o:p><o:p><a href="sparc.htm">SPARC</a> A spectral integral
            code that operates directly in the time domain. </o:p></o:p></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">There are generally no limits on
      the dimensions that can be handled (up to virtual memory). The
      code uses dynamic allocation for virtually all arrays. There are a
      few exceptions. You will generally get a flag if for some reason
      any dynamic memory allocation fails or if you have exceeded an
      intrinsic limit in the code.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">The documentation uses a common
      Fortran or Matlab syntax where a ( 1 : 5 ) represents a vector (
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ). The convention on model input is that such
      vectors are defined by first reading a line with the number of
      elements in the vector. Then the vector itself is read in.
      However, in reading the vector one can optionally provide just the
      first and last elements followed by a '/'. Thus, after specifying
      5 elements, the vector (1:5) can be read is as '1 5 /'<br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">For option letters in the various
      models, you will often see that there is a default. For instance,
      BELLHOP defaults to a point source in cylindrical coordinates, but
      you can explicitly select a point source ('R') or a line source
      ('X'). If you just want to go with the default, then simply put in
      a blank space for that position.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">The following modules are part of
      the package.</p>
    <h2>Group I: Mode Computations:</h2>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li><a href="kraken.htm">KRAKEN</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solves for
        the modes and writes them to disk. Elastic media are allowed but
        material attenuation in an elastic medium is ignored.</li>
      <li>KRAKENC&nbsp;&nbsp; A version of KRAKEN which finds the
        eigenvalues in the complex plane.&nbsp; KRAKEN uses perturbation
        theory to obtain imaginary parts of the eigenvalues while
        KRAKENC computes the complex eigenvalues exactly.&nbsp; KRAKENC
        runs about 3 times slower but is necessary for leaky mode
        computations or for including material attenuation in elastic
        media.&nbsp; Internally KRAKENC replaces elastic layers by an
        equivalent reflection coefficent. For this reason, you cannot
        use KRAKENC to look at fields within the elastic layers.</li>
      <li>KRAKEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analogous to KRAKENC but also
        computes elastic displacements and stresses for elastic media.
        KRAKEL is seldom used and tends to not be kept up-to-date.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Group II: Basic Plotting Routines:</h2>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTSSP&nbsp;&nbsp; Plots the sound speed profile.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTMODE&nbsp; Plots selected modes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTGRN&nbsp;&nbsp; Plots the Green's funtion for the
        depth separated wave equation for a particular source/receiver
        combination.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTTRI&nbsp;&nbsp; Plots the triangular elements used
        for 3-D field calculations. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Group III: Field Computations:</h2>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li>&nbsp; <a href="field.htm">FIELD</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Computes fields on a vertical array over a specified range and
        for a series of source depths. Individual phones in the array
        may be displaced from the vertical. Range dependence is handled
        by either adiabatic or one-way coupled mode theory.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; <a href="field3d.htm">FIELD3D</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Computes
        field for a three-dimensionally varying SSP using adiabatic mode
        theory.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Group IV: Plotting Routines that use Group III Program Output:</h2>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTSHD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plots tranmission
        loss in plan or elevation, i.e. an (x,y) plot or an (r,z) plot.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; PLOTRAYXY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plots the ray paths of the
        Gaussian beams generated during 3D field calculations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">The various programs for
      computing fields (GROUP III) are only needed for PLOTSHD, or for
      special user programs (e.g. ambiguity surfaces).</p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">The following extensions are used
      with these programs:</p>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">
      <li>&nbsp; .F90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        Fortran90/95 source code</li>
      <li>&nbsp; .HLP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A HeLP
        file documenting the module</li>
      <li>&nbsp; .BAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A BATch
        file which runs the module</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;">All user input in all modules is
      read using list-directed I/O. Thus data can be typed in
      free-format using space, tabs, commas or slashes as delimeters.
      Character input should be enclosed in single quotes like this:
      'CHARACTER INPUT'. You will see the '/' character in a number of
      the input files. This terminates an input line causing the program
      to use default values.</p>
    <h2>Directory Structure<br>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
    </p>
    <ul style="font-family: monospace;">

        Toolbox directory which contains command files for running
        KRAKEN and other models in the toolbox.</li>

      </li>
      <li>doc:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; html files with brief notes about
        how to run the models</li>
      <li>Krakel:&nbsp; A version of KRAKEN that provides the
        displacement field in elastic media. It does not presently
        include attenuation and is of limited practical use.</li>
