      Added option for reading tabulated reflection coefficient.<br>
      <br>
      <i>&nbsp;1/95</i><br>
      Added eigenray option which produces a ray plot but only for those
      rays which connect the source and receiver(s).<br>
      <br>
      <i>&nbsp;3/95</i><br>
      Sign changed on pressure field to make Bellhop consistent with the
      other models.<br>
      <br>
      <i>&nbsp;9/97</i><br>
      Option to propagate time series directly in Bellhop has been
      removed and replaced with the option of writing an arrivals file
      containing delays and amplitudes for each arrival. Phase changes
      have been pulled from the delay vector into a complex amplitude.
      Matlab script stackarr.m written to stack up the arrivals taking
      into account all phase changes.<br>
      <br>
      <i>11/97</i><br>
      The ray file is now written in ASCII rather than unformatted
      binary. This makes it easier for external programs to read ...<br>
      <br>
      <i>12/97</i><br>
      The option of including bottom bathymetry has been added.<br>
      <br>
      <i>&nbsp;5/98</i><br>
      Small boo-boo fixed. The / option for the sound speed profile is
      supposed to cause a default to the last used value. That didn't
      work for the lower halfspace ...<br>
      <br>
      <i>11/98</i><br>
      If you have a very reflective bottom, rays may end up propagating
      back towards the source. Bellhop has been modified to allow it to
      search backwards through bathymetry points to properly treat
      bottom reflections in this case. Also, the code now searches
      through as many subsequent bottom sections as necessary to find
      the proper patch of bottom. Thus, if you have a finely sampled
      bottom the code will be sure and advance far enough to get over
      the right patch even if your ray step length is large.<br>
      <br>
      <i>3/00</i><br>
      The arrivals file, which gives arrival times and amplitudes, now
      also gives the ray-angle.<br>
      <br>
      <i>1/01</i><br>
      The code previously took for granted that the first bathymetry
      point was given at range, r=0.0, i.e. directly below the source.
      It has now been extended to start by searching the bathymetry
      table to find the segment below the source. If no such segment
      exists, Bellhop generates an error message and terminates.<br>
      <br>
      <i>2/01</i><br>
      A phase error was corrected in the treatment of reflection by a
      halfspace (due to a sign error in calculating the angle of
      incidence). This problem was not present when halfspaces were
      first implemented but crept in during a subsequent modification.<br>
      <br>
      <i>2/01</i><br>
      A user doing an 'arrivals' run for 5000 ranges and 32 depths found
      that the maximum number of arrivals allowed per rcvr was 0. The
      associated matrices have been increased in size; a threshold has
      been set to always make the matrices big enough for at least 10
      arrivals; a facility has been added such that when there are too
      many arrivals, the program automatically keeps just the largest
      ones. Finally, tests have been added throughout where dynamic
      allocation is done, to generate an informative error message if
      the allocation fails due to insufficient (virtual) memory.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 2001</i><br>
      The option for using a top reflection coefficient had an error.
      Basically it produced a negative angle of incidence so that the
      lookup of the reflection coefficient always returned the value at
      0 degrees incidence. This did not effect bottom reflection
      coefficient tables.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 2001</i><br>
      Some fairly sizeable changes ... hopefully with no new
      introductions of bugs. The handling of non-smooth SSP's has been
      changed so that the code automatically adjusts the step size
      during the ray tracing so that it steps precisely onto those
      discontinuities (of cz). It also makes the requisite curvature
      change in the dynamic ray equations. With these changes, the code
      is now safe to use for piecewise linear profiles (option 'C' or
      'N' ). There is no effect in the spline option which automatically
      produces smooth profiles. I now suggest using the piecewise linear
      option for most cases, since if you don't take care with the
      spline option, it will wiggle significantly (even though it always
      passes through the given SSP points). Finally, I have modified the
      treatment of bottom reflections so that the code is more accurate
      for steeply sloping bottoms. The code used to handle the curvature
      corrections assuming the bottom was locally horizontal.<br>

    </div>
    <i> August 2001</i><br>
    Option added to output arrivals file in binary format.<br>
    <br>
    <i>December 2001</i><br>
    Correction to treatment of reflection coefficients. The original
    code treated the coefficient as being a function of the vertical
    angle. The current one treats it as a function of the angle of
    incidence (referenced to the normal to the bottom). This had
    previously caused an error in treating the surface reflection
    coefficient because the angles of incidence were negative.<br>
    <br>
    The option of having a non-flat surface has been added. The new
    version optionally reads an AltImetry file (ATIFIL) with that info.
    Also a bug was fixed that caused Bellhop to confuse the last SSP
    point with the bottom depth. These are the same when a bathymetry
    file is not used, but with a bathymetry file the use could specify a
    bathymetry point deeper that the last SSP point. (The bug only
    caused the code to run slower.)<br>
    <br>
    Bellhop has been changed throughout to use vector quantities for the
    ray coordinate, ray tangent, and bathymetry. This makes the code
    much more concise.<br>
    <br>
    <i>May 2002</i><br>
    More complete ray history information has been added to the arrivals
    file 'ARRFIL'. The file now includes the ray angle at the source and
    receiver as well as the number of surface and bottom bounces.<br>
    <br>
    A small modification has been made to ensure that the sound speed on
    the ray path is calculated at the terminal point of the ray. This
    info is used later in the TL calculation and causes a glitch for the
    last range. (Thanks to Lu Lian-Gang for bringing this to my
    attention.)<br>
    <br>
    An option has been added to give attenuation in terms of a 'loss
    parameter'.<br>
    <br>
    The arrivals file has been modified to write the amplitude and phase
    of the arrival rather than a complex amplitude. This facilitates
    interpolation of arrival data between environments in cases where
    there are many phase rolls between the environments. (The phase is
    'unwrapped' and therefore keeps track of the accumulated phase
    including all 360 degree loops of the origin.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>June 2002</i><br>
    With sloping bottoms, Bellhop can generate rays with angles of
    incidence greater than 90 degrees. (Imagine a vertically launched
    ray travelling downward to a bottom sloping upwards. It can also
    happen with rays that reverse direction due to upslope angle
    steepening.) Typically people only provide reflection coefficients
    to 90 degrees. The new version of Bellhop generates a warning
    message when it needs a reflection coefficient outside the tabulated
    domain. It also assumes the reflection coefficient is symmetric
    about 90 degrees. Thus an angle of incidence of 95 degrees is
    treated like 85 degrees.<br>
    <br>
    <i>October 2002</i><br>
    Added an option to include a source beam pattern. This is done by
    reading an array of values from a separate source beam-pattern file,
    SBPFIL.<br>
    <br>
    <i>November 2002</i><br>
    Bellhop was generating NaN's when sources were placed in the
    sub-bottom. The code was never set up to handle this; however, in
    some applications it was convenient to provide for this. The new
    version does so by terminating the ray trace immediately and
    producing a vanishing pressure contribution for such cases.<br>
    <br>
    <i>December 2002</i><br>
    The Thorp volume attenuation was not being applied in the case where
    an arrivals output file was selected (runtype 'A' or 'a').
    Separately the rough surface option (altimetry file) was being
    invoked from option letter 4 rather than 5 as specified in the
    documentation.<br>
    <br>
    <i>January 2003</i><br>
    The option for automatically calculating the number of beams to use
    has been implemented. This was in the documentation but somehow had
    never been put in. The formula used is often going to be too
    conservative, i.e. it tends to use more beams than you really need.<br>
    <br>
    <i>April 2004</i><br>
    When the number of receiver ranges was reduced (to 1 in the test
    case), a bug was causing an error in the computed TL. The problem
    was traced to an assumption in the code that the receiver sampling
    would be fine enough to catch phase changes resulting from caustics.
    Fixed ...<br>
    <br>
    <i>December 2005</i><br>
    Added a line source option.<br>
    <br>
    <i>January 2005</i><br>
    Improved the beam interpolation. Shortcomings were obvious in using
    Bellhop for nearly vertical propagation. Also fixed a problem in
    which the source coordinate was being counted as a caustic leading
    to an extra caustic phase change. Added an option for 'irregular'
    (as opposed to 'rectilinear') receiver coordinates. The purpose was
    to allow receivers following the bottom terrain, which in turn is
    needed for reverberation calculations. Invoking the option causes
    Bellhop to interpret receiver depths and ranges as pairs rather than
    defining a rectilinear grid.<br>
    <br>
    <i>October 2007</i><br>
    Added an option for curvilinear interpolation of the boundaries.
    This provides a smoother interpolation than the piecewise-linear
    option that had been the default. Smooth interpolation is important
    when the geometric ray option is invoked as geometric ray theory is
    very sensitive to interpolation issues. This option also requires a
    change in the format of the altimetry and bathymetry files--- an
    option letter has been added that selects piecewise-linear ('L') or
    curvilinear ('C'). The changes have been implemented in both the
    Fortran and Matlab versions of Bellhop.<br>
    <br>
    <i>November 2007</i><br>
    Bug in the treatment of altimetry/bathymetry files: Bellhop is
    supposed to extend boundaries to infinity in a constant fashion,
    using the values at the endpoints. This was not working properly and
    caused a problem when the user traced rays to a range beyond where
    the boundaries were defined.<br>
    <br>
    <i>December 2007</i><br>
    The Bellhop integrator is a polygon method that uses an Euler first
    step, followed by a midpoint correction. (The polygon or midpoint
    method is a second-order member of the Runge-Kutta family of codes.)
    A change was made to have Bellhop recheck the allowed step size in
    the second or midpoint phase. This provides a more accurate
    treatment of the boundary reflection.<br>
    <br>
    A new routine was added that checks all the limits on the ray step.
    The ray step is limited by top and bottom reflections, interface
    crossings (points where the SSP is sampled), and segment crossings
    (points where the bathymetry is sampled). With this addition, one
    does not need to worry about using a small range step in problems
    with fine sampling in the boundaries, since the code will carefully
    reduce the step size to land on such boundaries. This allows larger
    range steps, and therefore some increase speed.<br>
    <br>
    A section of code has been added to the code for geometric and
    Gaussian beams that does a coarse pre-check of the limits of
    receivers that may feel the influence of a beam. This speeds things
    up considerably since certain beam calculations can then be omitted
    for receivers that have no chance of receiving a beam contribution.<br>
    <br>
    An option was added for range-dependent sound speed profiles, which
    are specified on a rectangular grid and supplied in an extra SSP
    file. Beam curvature formulas have been updated to consider the
    gradients of the SSP in range.<br>
    <br>
    The logic has been implemented to calculate the TL associated with
    back-travelling rays. Until now, Bellhop could trace rays that went
    backwards, but could not calculate the field due to such rays.<br>
    <br>
    <i>April 2008</i><br>
    Fixed logic that was supposed to detect the last SSP point by an
    approximate match to the value of Depth. The test was too stringent,
    and didn't always find a match because of roundoff.<br>
    <br>
    <i>April 2009</i><br>
    Subroutine for reading tabulated reflection coefficients was not
    closing files and deallocating variables. Caused problems in KRAKEN
    runs with multiple profiles. that used such tabulated reflection
    coefficients.<br>
    <br>
    <i>December 2009</i><br>
    A trap was added in Bellhop to catch rays that escape the domain of
    the waveguide. This can happen when the curvilinear option is used
    and then significant CPU time is used to trace a ray to the storage
    limit, which does not contribute to the field. Converted vectors
    defining the ray to a structure in an attempt to improve readability
    and reduce cache failures. Converted some remaining variables to
    double precision, imagining that single precision saves little on
    run time, may even slow things down if conversions are required or
    compiler optimizations are blocked, and frequently turns out to be
    inadequate precision.<br>

    It was pointed out to me that the Quad SSP interpolation was doing
    linear extrapolation for values outside the grid, but that piecewise
    constant extrapolation would be better. My fix was supposed to limit
    the interpolation parameter, s, to the interval [ 0, 1 ] suppressing
    any extrapolation. However, min and max were switched so that s was
    always set to 0, effectively forcing piecewise constant
    interpolation/extrapolation in every segment of the grid. Fixed.<br>

    There was a bug in the new, vectorized, Fortran 2003 version in the
    case of a single receiver range. (The code was looking through the
    full length of the receiver vector, which includes a couple of
    special values used to produce a linearly spaced vector of receiver
    ranges. Fixed.<br>
    <br>
    <i>June 2011</i><br>
    Two small bugs fixed: the boundary curvature was not being set for
    the last segment of the bottom or top bathymetry. A dummy variable
    for the halfspace depth was not being set if the user used '/' for
    the completely halfspace specification. (Thanks to J. Peterson for
    reporting this.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>January 2012</i><br>
    A problem (bug) occurred if you didn't have the sound speed start a
    zero depth, because Bellhop was calculating the depth of the top
    boundary using the minval of the vector of depths where the sound
    speed was sampled. That included the whole length of the dimensioned
    array, rather than just the part used to store the sound speed, so
    it was using a depth of zero for the top boundary. Actually some
    parts of the code had the zero depth, and some parts depended on the
    shallowest depth for the SSP, which is what caused problems. This
    has been fixed to always use the first depth of the SSP. For ocean
    acoustic problems, this normally implies that you should make sure
    you have an SSP point at zero depth, since the rays will reflect at
    the depth of that first SSP point. <br

    A range-dependent bottom (or top) type is now allowed in Bellhop.
    The information is added in to the bathymetry (or altimetry) file.
    Major changes have been made throughout to use more structure
    variables. The code has also been re-structured to facilitate
    writing a Mex wrapper so that the Fortran Bellhop can be called from
    Matlab.<br>
    <p><i>February 2013</i><br>
      When a source is placed on an SSP point, which is also a local
      minimum then a horizontally launched ray is a pathological
      situation. If its launch angle or position were slightly perturbed
      then it would generate a ray that cycles repeatedly in tiny loops.
      The logic for dynamically adjusting the step size along a ray has
      always been confused by this and Bellhop would take
      infinitessimally small steps until running out of storage space
      for the ray. The new version detects this pathological case and
      uses the standard stepsize. Hopefully this will not have other bad
      side effects.<br>
      <br>
      <i>March 2013</i><br>
      A term involving the rz derivative of the SSP had been neglected
      when the Quad option was used to interpolate a 2D SSP. Similarly,
      curvature changes in crossing range-segments in the SSP had been
      ignored. Fixed ... Logic was also added so that the ray stepsize
      would be automatically adjusted to land on the ranges defining the
      SSP. Previously we had required the user to control that through
      the bathymetry or altimetry file.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 2013</i><br>
      Changes made to make it easier to call Bellhop as a subroutine
      from Matlab. In particular all the variables can easily be set
      from the main routine or by reading them from an envfil.<br>
      Fixed an error in the formula that handles changes in beam
      curvature during boundary reflection. The earlier formula
      implicitly assumed the sound speed gradient was perpendicular to
      the boundary. This was also fixed in Bellhop3D for both Nx2D and
      3D options. The results are clearly improved when there is a
      complicated bathymetry together with ocean SSP gradients.<br>
      <br>
      <i>February 2014</i><br>
      There is a further curvature correction to beams when they reflect
      from a curved boundary. (Boundaries in Bellhop can either be
      curved or piecewise linear.) The curvature correction had the
      wrong sign for the curvature.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 2014</i><br>
      The arrivals file had inaccurate receive angles in the case when
      Gaussian beams were used. Bellhop was storing the receiver angle
      associated with the last beam contributing to a given receiver
      location. This was not very accurate. Bellhop has been modified to
      use the average angle of all the contributing beams (in a group of
      beams associated with a certain eigenray). Bellhop3D has also been
      modified accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      <i>April 2015</i><br>
      The logic in the routine that calculates the beam influence for
      Geometric Gaussian beams had been rearranged for greater
      efficiency. In the process a factor of 2 was dropped in
      calculating the intensity with the incoherent field option. Thus
      incoherent calculations with Geometric Gaussian beams were coming
      out 3 dB too low. This error affected the 2015 release of Bellhop.<br>
      <br>
      <i>June 2015</i><br>
      A user wanted to see ray traces for multiple source depths in the
      same plot. A minor modification was done to permit this.<br>
      <br>
      <i>November 2015</i><br>
      Bellhop had used an approximate treatment of ocean volume
      attenuation based directly on the cylindrical range to the
      receiver. The volume attenuation should really be based on the
      path length of the ray. This has been a standard approximation in
      ray models; however, it does not always work well. For instance,
      for HF acoustic modems in deep water being used over a vertical
      path, this approximation yields 0 loss (since the cylindrical
      range to the receiver is 0), thus ignoring significant loss in the
      depth direction. Furthermore, Bellhop had no provision for a
      depth-dependent volume attenuation. Both Bellhop and Bellhop3D
      have been modified to allow a depth-dependent attenuation and to
      incorporate losses in terms of the length of the ray path. The
      changes to do this were simple but numerous. All the routines for
      interpolating the soundspeed profile were modified to return a
      complex sound speed. The option to write an arrivals file was
      modified to write a complex delay where the imaginary part
      represents the attenuation along the eigenray path. Matlab outines
      that read the arrivals file were also modified. All the beam
      influence routines were modifed to incorporate the complex
      delay.&nbsp; A new test case ('VolAtt') was added to exercise the
      new capability. With so many changes, I assume some bugs will show
      up, despite the extensive testing.<br>
      <br>
      <i>April 2016</i><br>
      The incoherent calculations for Geometric Gaussian beams were
      still about 1.6 dB too low. I had assumed loosely that two
      adjacent beams were contributing. I modified the formulat to use
      the sum of an infinite number of beams (with increasing distance
      form the receiver). This was actually the process that had always
      been used for the *coherent* sum, but I had been less careful with
      the incoherent sum. The updated formula now increases to a
      fracyion of a dB with what had been in the Geometric Hat beams.
      Further refinements are possible for refracted media.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 2016</i><br>
      Fixed an error in Bellhop3D using Geometric Hat beams in Cartesian
      coordinates: the old version would generally have a beam make a
      contribution to a radial and its continuation in the other half
      plane. For instance, if the beam made a contribution to the
      45-degree radial, it would also show an erroneus contribution to
      the 225-degree radial.<br>
      <br>
      <i>August 2016</i><br>
      Added an option for geometric hat beams in ray-centered
      coordinates (rather than Cartesian coordinates). The geometric
      beams in Cartesian coordinates have been a standard. Only the
      Cerveny-style beams had been implemented in ray-centered
      coordinates. The interpolation of the beams works better with
      ray-centered coordinates, especialy for beams that are nearly
      vertical. However, the Cartesian beams require less computation.<br>
      <br>
      <i>September 2016</i><br>
      Fixed a bug in Bellhop3D in which the 2D option was not clearing
      the pressure field for a radial. As a result, the field on new
      radials had the field in storage from the previous radial in areas
      that would have been shadows.<br>
      <br>
      Modified the Gaussian beams in ray-centered coordinates to use the
      same algorithm as that used for hat beams in ray-centered
      coordinates. The new code is faster by about 4x. (That factor
      depends on lots of particulars of the problem and the set up.)<br>
      <br>
      Bellhop reads the SSP data to a user-specified depth. That depth
      was being converted to single precision and then in a rare case
      did not produce a match at the last SSP point due to the lower
      precision. Fixed.<br>
      <br>
      Added (but did not test) curvilinear altimetry option based on the
      analogous bathymetry option.<br>
      <br>
      For Geometric, (Gaussian and hat beams) in ray-centered
      coordinates the 'Arrivals' option was incorrectly using a ray
      matrix from the 2D case (ray2D vs. ray3D). Fixed.<br>
      <br>
      <i>October 2016</i><br>
      The Bellhop3D altimetry option had probably never been tested. I
      created a directory 'ParaBot' with a parabolic altimetry and
      bathymetry file based on the same case in the Bellhop tests. It
      turned out this had never worked properly. The logic is, of
      course, almost identical to the bathymetry case but it wasn't
      quite right. Based on the ParaBot test it looks like it is now
      working correctly. The pressure field is symmetric about the
      horizontal axis, indicating the altimetry and bathymetry files are
      being treated the same way. the match with the normal Bellhop is
      not quite perfect and deserves another look. However, it is
      awfully close.<br>
      <br>
      Bellhop and Bellhop3D have always ignored the density in the
      volume assuming it was seawater and could be treated as a
      constant. That constant was taken as 1.0 gm/cm^2, which is very
      slightly off. In running an aero-acoustic problem for the air that
      density is about 1000x too high which led to an incorrect boundary
      reflection coefficient. Both models have been modified to use the
      density as specified in the environmental file including its depth
      variation. This effects about 6 different types of interpolation
      options in both models; however, I have just tested the c-linear
      option and only in Bellhop.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 2017</i><br>
      The logic in Bellhop3D had always been sloppy in terms of how it
      would handle a ray that exited the domain where the bathymetry or
      altimetry was defined. This could result in accesses to undefined
      variables. (Bellhop handles this by extending the domain as a
      constant.) Bellhop3D has been modified to terminate the ray trace
      for the particular take-off angle involved when this happens. The
      ray trace then continues to the next launch angle.<br>
      <br>
      Often problems in the ray trace occur because of user errors in
      defining the bathymetry. For instance, NaNs are often present.
      Bellhop3D now checks for such NaNs when they're first read and
      generates a warning message. It also tries to detect when a ray
      has entered a patch where the bathymetry is improperly defined
      (because of the Nan) and then terminates the trace of that
      particular ray.<br>
      <br>
      A problem was also present in that Bellhop3D did not always check
      for each new ray which bathymetry/altimetry segment the source was
      over/under. This has been fixed; however, I need to review this
      since Bellhop uses a different process where it *always* searches
      for the active segment. This is less efficient but safer. In any
      case, Bellhop and Bellhop3D should likely be set up the same way.<br>
      <br>
      The Bellhop3D ascii arrivals file has been modified so that it is
      stylistically consistent with the Bellhop version. (Previously the
      delay information was written as a complex number by Bellhop3D vs.
      two reals in Bellhop.)<br>
      <br>
      <i>December 2017</i><br>
      The arrivals option for the case of an Nx2D run had not been
      implemented. This feature was added so that an arrivals
      calculation can be done with either Nx2D or 3D options.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 2018</i><br>
      The geometric Gaussian beam options in Bellhop and Bellhop3D use a
      'stent' which sets a lower limit on how narrow a beam can be. That
      lower limit is based on arclength from the source so that it
      allows narrow beams close to the source. Otherwise the beams add
      up to too high a level. Bellhop and Bellhop3D had been using just
      a coarse estimate of arclength based on the number of steps times
      the stepsize. However, that estimate was way off in cases where
      the default stepsize is chosen to be really large. That is
      normally OK because the codes adjust the stepsize down
      automatically as the ray steps along. However, the number of steps
      times the stepsize then overestimates the arclength in a big way.
      Both codes have been modified to estimate the arclength using the
      travel time delay, which is tracked as part of the ray trace and
      incorporates the dynamic changes in steplength.<br>
      <br>
      The semi-coherent option in Bellhop was over-riding any source
      beam pattern if that was provided. Fixed.<br>
      <br>
      The Gaussian beam option in Bellhop3D (in 3D mode) now can be done
      in the original ray-centered coordinates or in Cartesian
      coordinates. The latter is vastly faster.<br>
      <br>
      <i>June 2018</i><br>
      The treatment of volume attenuation in the Matlab version of
      Bellhop has been upgraded to be consistent with the Fortran
      version. (See note dated November 2015.)<br>
      The fix of Feb. 2013 was also incorporated in BellhopM</p>
    <p><i>July 2018</i><br>
      The Matlab version of Bellhop (BellhopM) has the wrong sign on the
      phase changes that happen when a ray crosses a caustic (because I
      used ' instead of .' on the associated vector, inadvertently
      conjugating it). Fixed. The arclength correction from May 2018 was
      also implemented in BellhopM.<br>
      <br>
      A problem showed up in Bellhop3D when rays were traced over a
      bathymetry given in Eastings and Northings. Those values are in
      the millions, but described (in this case) a small patch. The ray
      steps are around 1 m and when written in single precion to the ray
      file, the ray coordinates in Easting and Northings don't have
      enough precision. The rays then look jittery. The fix was simply
      to write the ray file in double precision. This was changed in the
      regulard 2D Bellhop as well, although it's less likely one would
      create a Bellhop file with that kind of problem.<br>
      <br>
      There were lines in WriteArrivals for the 3D case that factored in
      1 / sqrt( r ) for a point source and something else for a line
      source. Neither one makes sense in a 3D run so they were removed.
      The 3D code does the equivalent of a sqrt( r) through the actual
      spreading of the beams in each direction; a line source would
      require a different treatment because of the 3D.<br>
      <br>
      The format for ARRFiles generated by Bellhop3D has been modified
      to write the number of bearings (as well as receiver depths and
      ranges). Azimuthal angles at the source and receiver were also
      added to the ARRFile.<br>
      <br>
      When Bellhop3D was run in the Nx2D mode it was neglecting to make
      the normals to the boundaries have unit length. (They were
      projections of the 3D normal vectors onto the 2D propagation
      plane; that process changed the length of the normal vectors.) As
      a result the angles of reflection were slightly off producing
      errors in the results.<br>
      <br>
      <i>August 2018</i><br>
      The previous version created pyramidal beams with a rectangular
      base. Thus rotations of the q_tilde, q_hat coordinates were
      ignored. The new version takes these into account yielding
      pyramidal beams with a parallelogram base. The resulting beams
      then produce what could be called a tiling, with essentially no
      gaps or overlaps between adjacent beams. A lot of work was also
      done to handle boundary curvature. When the curvilinear boundary
      option is selected it now automatically calculates the boundary
      curvature in each direction and applies jumps to the q functions
      (related to beam curvature) when the beams reflect off those
      boundaries. The previous version only incorporated curvature in
      calculating the angle of the reflected rays.<br>
      <br>
      <i>November 2018</i><br>
      The option for a bottom type that varied with range was not
      working properly. A confusion in the order of the real and
      imaginary parts of the P-wave and S-wave speeds was causing the
      sound speed attenuation to be ignored. An additional bug had been
      introduced when the broadband option was introduced into the
      acoustic toolbox-- the routine for converting attenuation to a
      complex sound speed was missing a newly introduced variable. Fixed
      ...<br>
      <br>
      <i>December 2018</i><br>
      The density interpolation with the hexahedral option was not
      interpolating density correctly. Since a varying density is rarely
      used in ocean acoustics this problem would likely not have shown
      up in any practical case. A modification has been made so that it
      is now interpolated ln linearly in depth. However, the
      interpolation is piecewise constant in x and y.<br>
      <br>
      <i>January 2019</i><br>
      PCHIP, Spline, and N2-linear SSP options added to the Matlab
      version of BELLHOP.<br>
      <br>
      <i>February 2019</i><br>
      2D or 3D soundspeeds are read in from an auxilliary SSPFILE. In
      that case, a depth-dependent volume attenuation can be input in
      the envfil. However, the attenuation was being interpolated
      incorrectly due to a confusion between depth into a layer and the
      proportional depth in the layer. This has been fixed but not
      tested. Note that the depths for the SSP values must match between
      the ENVFILE and the SSPFILE. There is currently no check to
      enforce that.<br>
      <br>
      The François-Garrison formulas for volume attenuation have been
      added as an alternative to the older Thorp formula. In the process
      of doing this I found that I had volume attenuation incorporated
      twice in the Matlab version of BELLHOP. This error was introduced
      in June 2018 (see above) when I switched from handling attenuation
      by a simple formula based on cylindrical range to a more accurate
      one based on attenuation along the arc of the ray path. I failed
      to remove the older range formula when I added the new one.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 2019</i><br>
      The incoherent option with paraxial beams (Cerveny) was producing
      levels that were way too low. The code was summing the absolute
      values of the pressures, rather than the intensities (pressure
      squared). With that corrected for both beams in Cartesian
      coordinates and ray-centered beams, the levels are better, but
      they still seem a bit off. However, the idea of incoherently
      summing beams that are in the same family does not really make
      sense.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a full 360 degree sweep of rays, BELLHOP and
      BELLHOP3D were supposed to automatically remove a duplicate beam
      at, e.g. -180 and 180 degrees. The coding was done lazily, testing
      for exact equality and with round-off that test was not always
      satisfied. The code has been modified to test for approximate
      equality. This modification is of little importance, but it does
      eliminate an artifact in at/tests/BeamPattern/omni.<br>
      <br>
      BELLHOP3D was not including the volume attenuation when the
      incoherent/semi-coherent option was selected.<br>
      <br>
      <i>June 2019</i><br>
      Elasticity in the halfspaces has been included. Note that BOUNCE
      can be used to generate reflection coefficients for elastic
      halfspaces and even more complicated layered sub-bottoms. Then the
      resulting reflection coefficient can be used in BELLHOP. However,
      this modification simplifies the process for halfspaces.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 2020</i><br>
      There is a hidden option in BELLHOP to include a beam shift on
      boundary reflection. (It is hidden or undocumented because it is
      not considered to be reliable.) That option was being ignored when
      a ray trace run was selected. As a result, the ray plots did not
      reflect the true trajectories that were using in a TL calculation.
      Fixed ... This beamshift option is available in both BELLHOP and
      BELLHOP3D, but will not produce reliable results with complicated
      bottoms. There is no logic in the software to deal with the fact
      that a displaced ray/beam may be moved to the next bathymetric
      domain. However, this change at least ensures the ray plots will
      represent the underlying behavior for the TL.</p>
    <p><i>August 2020</i><br>
      In the test case at/tests/BeamPattern/omni.env there are
      homogeneous lossless halfspaces for the top and bottom.
      Calculating the boundary impedance uses a square root to get a
      vertical wavenumber. In this special case it it taking the square
      root of a negative real. It turns out the gfortran and Intel
      compilers do different things with those negative reals (which lie
      on the the branch cut of the square root). They both give a purely
      imaginary value, but with different signs. The Fortran standard
      does not lock this down and the behavior can also be a function of
      the machine architecture. The effect was to generate a divide by
      zero with the Intel compiler. This was trapped with all the traps
      enabled. Logic has been added to force the desired sign and fix
      this inconsistency.<br>
      <br>
      This error could occur with elastic layers and/or with other codes
      in the Acoustics Toolbox. However, one would rarely use a lossless
      halspace in those models. Also, SCOOTER, for instance always works
      a little off the real axis and wouldn't experience this. This also
      might be an issue in&nbsp; the Matlab version of BELLHOP depending
      on the architecture.<br>
      <br>
      <i>September 2020</i><br>
      An error was showing up in the Fortran BELLHOP under gfortran 9.2,
      but not earlier versions of gfortran and not the Intel Fortran.
      The error caused the ray trace to take a large number of small
      steps. I found that the stepsize, h, had been declared as INTENT(
      OUT ), when it should have been INTENT( INOUT ) since a maximum
      step was being passed, that was supposed to be reduced by
      ReduceStep. So the step size is both an input value and an output
      value. Fixed. This error also was present in BELLHOP3D although
      there had been no reports of problems. It has been fixed there
      also.<br>
      <br>
      <i>October 2020</i><br>
      When the number of beams selected was 1, BELLHOP and BELLHOP3D
      interpreted this as a full 360 degree sweep (since the difference
      between the first and last beam MOD( 360 ) is 0. In such cases it
      decrements the number of beams resulting in 0 beams. Using just
      one declination angle would be a rare choice in BELLHOP; however,
      in BELLHOP3D it can make sense to trace just one bearing angle for
      an Nx2D run. In addition, a small change was made to ensure that
      the vectors for these angles are always allocated to a minimum
      length of 3. This is necessary because of the coding to
      automatically generate linearly interpolated values, which is
      flagged in the third element.<br>

      A user was finding that BELLHOP3D was failing for a specific
      azimuthal take-off angle for the beams. The error message was that
      there was not enough storage for the ray. The cause of this was
      that the ray was in a valley with the source precisely on the line
      of the bathymetry that defined the minimum of the valley, and
      launching along the same angle as that line. As a result, the ray
      tracer sends the ray ping-ponging back and forth across that line
      segment, always taking micro-steps since it tries to ensure that a
      ray steps onto all interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      BELLHOP and BELLHOP3D have now been modified so that the
      'microsteps' are larger. The above described behavior still
      occurs, but fewer steps are consumed in bouncing around the line
      of the valley minimum. As a result, there is much less likelihood
      of running out of storage. The same problem can occur if a ray is
      launched along line defining a minimum in the ocean SSP. This can
      happen in BELLHOP and BELLHOP3D. In cases where the number of
      steps is a problem, this can be resolved by offsetting the source.

    We were trying to model an air-over-water case by putting an air
    layer into the same medium as the water. (Recall that BELLHOP only
    allows one 'medium'; in KRAKEN and SCOOTER we would handle this with
    separate media.) Other people have done this successfully for ocean
    over sediment problems. BELLHOP is not really designed for this and
    it will not produce both transmitted and reflected rays at the
    air/water interface. Instead, it gets a sort of reflection from the
    gradient between air and water for rays below the critical angle; it
    gets a sort of transmission between air and water for rays above the
    critical angle.<br>
    <br>
    If you do this, you generally want to spread that transition between
    air and water over a meter or so. The reason is that the numerical
    integrator is very inaccurate with sharp gradients in the SSP. You
    can also address that by putting a lot of SSP points in the
    transition layer. That forces BELLHOP to use a step size that lands
    on each SSP point, i.e. the numerical integrator uses small steps
    through the transition layer. So this is not a bug fix, but an alert
    about properly handling SSPs with extremely strong gradients.
    Regardless of how you sample the SSP, you must not have duplicate
    depths. In other words there must be a transition layer of nonzero
    thickness between air and water.<br>

    When BELLHOP3D was run in the Nx2D mode for an arrivals calculation,
    it was not writing the source and receiver azimuthal angles (which
    are equal to each other in an Nx2D run) to the arrivals file This
    causes problems in post-processing if the user is interpolating the
    field between bearing lines.<br>
    <br>
    <i>July 2021</i><br>
    When BELLHOP3D was run in the Nx2D mode for an eigenray calculation,
    it was writing the ray file in the 2D format used by the standard
    BELLHOP. As a result, the rays could not be plotted using
    plotray3d.m. They also could not be plotted by plotray.m used by
    BELLHOP because the header for the ray file said it was a 3D ray
    file.<br>
    <br>
    When BELLHOP3D was run in the Nx2D mode for an arrivals calculation
    it was omitting a necessary sqrt( r ) factor to account for
    cylindrical spreading. As a result the Nx2D and 3D results were
    typically very similar, but with different levels.<br>
    <br>
    If a ray hits the boundary very close to a node were the bathymetry
    (or altimetry) is sampled, that ray can escape (slip through the
    boundary). This is a detail of the algorithm, but it always steps
    just barely over the boundary and then applies the change in
    direction due to the reflection. However, if that happens right near
    a node then that ray hits other logic that forces it to land on
    interfaces in range. Then with two adjacent ray points outside the
    boundary,&nbsp; the algorithm kills the ray, deciding it has managed
    to escape. This happened in at/tests/parabot for ray 118 (but
    interestingly only with gfortran and without the runtime checks on).
    It has been fixed by reducing the amount of the (small) overstep
    that BELLHOP does on reflections. However, this is not a universal
    fix, so it may (rarely) show up in other cases.<br>

    In a harbor scenario that was 20 m x 20 m x 200 m we found that a
    ray could step way past the bounding box. The particular case has a
    50 Hz source leading to a 2-m default stepsize. The bounding box
    only kills off a ray when it has stepped outside the box, which is a
    fairly rough test. Both BELLHOP and BELLHOP3D have been modified to
    treat the bounding box like other interfaces and make careful
    adjustments to make sure the ray steps very precisely on the
    bounding box (actually a very small fraction of the default stepsize
    past that). This allows more precise treatment for confined cases
    like this.<br>

    </i>A user created a BELLHOP3D bathymetry file with the
    y-coordinates <i>decreasing</i> monitonically. The code assumes x
    and y coordinates <i>increase</i> monotonically and fails if they
    don't. A test has been added to flag this error, which otherwise
    would cause the code to terminate mysteriously.<br>

    A user found that with the Intel compiler an ASCII arrivals file was
    wrapped at 80 characters causing the output info to be split between
    two lines. This in turn affected their reader for the arrival file.
    It turns out that the Fortran standard does not regulate this and
    wrapping is not done by gfortran. A switch was added to the Makefile
    -no-wrap-margin to change this. However, people should be aware that
    this problem may occur with other compilers. It can also be fixed by
    adding a logical record length in the OPEN statement for the file or
    by using an explicit format statement instead of the list-directed
    output. None of these solutions is ideal.<br>
    <br>
    A user converted BELLHOP/BELLHOP3D to C++ and did meticulous checks
    to make sure ray paths and other outputs were 'identical' with
    different architectures and between the Fortran and the C++
    versions. This was a very nice cross-check. Most of the differences
    had no practical import or they addressed parts of the code that are
    no longer used or supported. Trivial changes are not reporter here;
    however, three changes were more significant bugs:<br>
    1) the ray normal calculation in BELLHOP3D was using the rotation
    angle ray2%phi (which was uniinitialized). It was supposed to use
    ray1%phi,<br>
    2) the ray phase in the 2D Gaussian Cartesian beam was using the
    (undefined) phase at step iS instead of the correct phase at step
    iS-1 used for all the other beams,<br>
    3) the interpolation of the phase (phaseInt) in a zone that had just
    crossed a caustic was using phaseInt = phase + pi / 2 instead of the
    correct formula phaseInt = phaseInt + pi / 2.<br>
    These errors have been corrected and may have affected the
    interference patterns in the coherent TL plots for different cases.<br>
